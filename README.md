# ReactRedux


This is a full stack project to familiarise end to end best practice. I use React paired with redux and react router for the front end alot with oAuth through Passport.js. My back end is Node.JS with Express framework, connected to a NoSQL database via Mlab.com. I have incorporated Stripe and Sendgrid API's to both front and back integration.
